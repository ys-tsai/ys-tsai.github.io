I am a <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/yi-shan-tsai/">Senior Lecturer at the Department of Data Science and AI in the Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University</a> in Melbourne, Australia. I am a core member of <a href="https://www.monash.edu/it/dsai/learning-analytics"> the Centre for Learning Analytics at Monash (CoLAM)</a>. 

## What I do
My research aims to enhance learning, teaching, and educational environments with the adoption of digital and data technologies. In particular, my research investigates social-technical issues and pedagogical implications around the use of learning analytics and AI. I am interested in enhancing feedback processes and supporting learners and educators to develop feedback literacy by leveraging AI-powered technologies. I was one of the early pioneers on feedback analytics, which applies learning analytics techniques to track learner engagement with feedback and provide personalised support to scaffold feedback literacy. A representative project in this area of work is <a href= "https://www.polyfeed.com.au/"> PolyFeed</a>.

## Before Monash
Before joining Monash, I was a <a href= "https://www.de.ed.ac.uk/people/yi-shan-tsai">postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh (2016-2020) </a> where I had a lead role on several multi-national projects, collaborating with a wide range of partners in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Australia. My representative work during this period of time was the <a href= "https://sheilaproject.eu/sheila-framework/"> SHEILA framework </a>, which has informed policy development for learning analytics in over 200 higher education institutions around the world.

As an interdisciplinary researcher, I have research expertise in areas including learning analytics, digital education, feedback, multimodal literacy, and reading cultures. Before moving into the field of educational technology, my research focused on children's engagement with multimodal texts including picturebooks and comic books. I hold a PhD and an MPhil degree in Education from the University of Cambridge. Prior to working in the higher education context, I worked extensively with children aged between 9 and 15 as a school teacher. 

## My Philosophy
I believe that effective educational technologies need to be human-centred, value-sensitive, theoretically grounded, and pedagogically aligned. This has shaped my approaches to the design and implementation of educational technologies.

My teaching philosophy is informed by my research paradigm–constructivism. I believe that learning is constructed by what learners bring and how they interpret the world, and that teaching is a process of knowledge exchange between the educator and the learner. I appreciate the opportunities to work with several talented students, and have had the honour to receive the <a href= "https://mga.monash.edu/get-involved/annual-awards/soty/"> MGA Supervisor of the Year Award </a> in 2025.

## Professional experience
I am a Fellow of UK Higher Education Academy (FHEA)(Advance HE). I was an Honorary Fellow at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh (2019 -- 2024). I am an Associate Editor of <a href= "https://ajet.org.au/">  Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) </a>. I served as an executive member of <a href= "https://www.solaresearch.org/"> the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) </a> between 2019 and 2024, and had the honour to hold positions including Vice President and the Communication Working Group Chair. During my service on the SoLAR committee, I started a podcast programme <a href= "https://www.solaresearch.org/community/podcast/"> (SoLAR Spotlight: Conversations on Learning Analytics)</a> and established the SoLAR ECR Grant Programme to support early career researchers.
